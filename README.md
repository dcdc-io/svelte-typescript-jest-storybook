# Svelte => TypeScript => Jest => StoryBook => An Atomic Design Boilerplate

This boilerplate is extracted from a work in progress project and won't get much attention in and of itself right now.

If you are starting a project that combines all the above, then fork this repository.

## Commands:

### Run tests:

> `yarn test`

### Storybook:

To run with hot reloading:

> `yarn storybook` 

To produce a static build:

> `yarn build-storybook` to build 

### App:

To build:

> `yarn build`

To serve (the built version):

> `yarn start`

To dev serve with hot reloading:

> `yarn dev`
